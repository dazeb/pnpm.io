### Minor Changes

Added network performance monitoring to pnpm by implementing warnings for slow network requests, including both metadata fetches and tarball downloads.

Added configuration options for warning thresholds: `fetchWarnTimeoutMs` and `fetchMinSpeedKiBps`.
Warning messages are displayed when requests exceed time thresholds or fall below speed minimums
