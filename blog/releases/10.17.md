### Minor Changes

The `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` setting now supports patterns.
<!-- truncate -->
For instance:

```yaml
minimumReleaseAge: 1440
minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
- "@eslint/*"
```

### Patch Changes

- Don't ignore the `minimumReleaseAge` check, when the package is requested by exact version and the packument is loaded from cache [#9978](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9978).
- When `minimumReleaseAge` is set and the active version under a dist-tag is not mature enough, do not downgrade to a prerelease version in case the original version wasn't a prerelease one [#9979](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9979).
